Welcome to the Time Converter! 

This project is designed to convert a given time reading to an analog display. 

Alternatively, you can use see the system's current time in an analog display.

To use this project, run the "Main" file, and enter the desired time into the values. You must enter something for all three text boxes, so if you want an exact value, use 0.

Once the time is entered, press the "Convert Time" button, or if the current time is desired, the "Convert Current Time" button.
